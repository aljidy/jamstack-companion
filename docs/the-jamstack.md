## Static Site Generators

### Description

This session will go into details about static site builders and give an example of just how quickly you can put something online using free technologies. We will be using the JAMStack website to create an example 11ties site.

### Why this is important

This session will give the students knowledge on tools available to deploy their code online. They will be able to use this to showcase their CV. This can also be very useful for someone who wants to work on a personal website/ blog. The process we will show them automates the creation of the website and git repository. JAMStacks method of working is fast becoming industry standard for high performance sites so this is good industry knowledge.

### Outcomes

Following this training you will be able to: Use Jamstack to create new projects quickly

### Learner Requirements

Github desktop

### Outline

1. How does the web work
2. Difference between CMS and SSG
3. Jamstack Demo
4. Advantages
5. Tasks

## Working with Git

### Description

This session will go into more information about how to use git and the advantages of using git. We will be making edits to the static site we created in the previous session. To do so this will require the users to download the repo created to their machines.

### Why this is important

This session will expose the learners to more information about git and how it works. This is very good practise as they will be fetching a repo onto their machine and making changes and uploading them via git. This is turn will update the static site on netlify which will also expose the students to a complete deployment process

### Outcomes

Following this training you will be able to: Understand the whole process for static site generation as a continuation from the last session. The students will be able to explain the process of downloading a repo, making a new branch, changing the code, committing the changes, merging the branch and pushing to origin.

### Learner Requirements
