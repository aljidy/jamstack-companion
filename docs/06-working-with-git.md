## **Description**

This session will go into more information about how to use git and the advantages of using git. We will be making edits to the static site we created in the previous session. To do so this will require the users to download the repo created to their machines.

## **Why this is important**

This session will expose the learners to more information about git and how it works. This is very good practise as they will be fetching a repo onto their machine and making changes and uploading them via git. This is turn will update the static site on netlify which will also expose the students to a complete deployment process

## **Outcomes**

Following this training you will be able to: Understand the whole process for static site generation as a continuation from the last session. The students will be able to explain the process of downloading a repo, making a new branch, changing the code, committing the changes, merging the branch and pushing to origin.
