## **Description**

This session learners will be taught about how to write a function in Javascript. The learners will also have to call the function to make it run. They will be introduced to control flow and how to use logic inside of a function to return an output.

## **Why this is important**

All functional languages follow similar rules, this session educates the learners on how to pass arguments to a function and what logic to apply to those arguments in order to return something back to the process. Understanding control flow is a huge part of the job, the learners will be taught what logic is available to them whilst problem solving.

## **Outcomes**

Following this training you will be able to: Create functions in javascript, pass arguments to the function, apply logical code to the arguments passed in order to return something from the function.

## **Learner Requirements**
