Being able to build apps using the JAMStack is a skill-set which is in high demand among employers right now, and that demand is only set to continue rising in 2021 and beyond.

“JAMstack is an architecture designed to make the web faster, more secure, and easier to scale. It builds on many of the tools and workflows which developers love, and which bring maximum productivity.”

On this course, we’ll be recapping the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as teaching accessibility and responsive design principles. Then we’ll look at solving problems with JavaScript, and explore the tools and frameworks which you’ll use to master the skills of modern development.

This is a course for people wanting to move to the next level in coding to launch a new career. Whether you’re just getting started and have dabbled in HTML and CSS before, or are already working in a basic developer role in different languages, this is a great opportunity to learn valuable new skills fast.
