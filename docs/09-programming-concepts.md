This session will introduce the learners to Javascript. They will learn about variables/ data types, the console and arithmetic operators

## **Why this is important**

This session will show the learners how to lay out their code and structure simple functional programmes. The purpose of this lesson is to help the learners understand how to think like a programmer/ talk to a computer.

## **Outcomes**

Following this training you will be able to: Create very basic procedural code and explain the differences between the different data types and arithmetic operators available.

## **Learner Requirements**

VS code

Github desktop

## **Outline**

1. What is Javascript?
2. What can you do with Javascript
3. How to apply Javascript to your website code
4. Output methods
5. Variables, Data types and Mathematical operators
6. Task

## **Tasks**

### **Mandatory**

**1 We’ll make a program to calculate a tip**

1. Create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage
2. Calculate the new total
3. Output a sentence to the page - something like:

Your total bill, with tip, is £35.45

BONUS POINTS:

1. Use toFixed() to round the output to 2 decimal places
2. Display the tip amount in the output as well

**2 Extend the Tip program**

1. Create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage
2. Calculate the new total
3. Output a sentence to the page - something like:

“Your total bill, with tip, is £35.45”

Extension: round the figure to 2 DP and display the tip amount.

### **Additional**

Make a Procedural Function in Javascript.
